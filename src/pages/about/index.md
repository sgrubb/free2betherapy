### About me

Hello, my name is Genene and I am a qualified and accredited Play Therapist (MBAPT). 

I have been working within the mental health field for over seven years, providing therapeutic workshops, crisis support and recovery work within both in-patient and community settings. I have also gained years of experience working within nursery and educational environments, delivering specialist support to children with both mental health and special educational needs. 

As a Play Therapist, I have conducted short-term and long-term therapeutic interventions in school and charity settings, supporting children with a variety of complex needs. I am very passionate about early intervention and working preventively to ensure the most beneficial and enduring outcomes for children and young people by supporting them to thrive.

I am trained under a humanistic, person-centred model of therapy which recognises intuitively the key role of play in healthy development and how it can be used to support childrenâ€™s emotional and behavioural needs. I have also received extensive training in subjects such as child development, attachment and infant observation and gained specialised knowledge surrounding key issues affecting children and young people, such as abuse, bereavement, learning difficulties, family break down and bullying. Through my mental health work, I have also participated in further professional development to expand my clinical knowledge around domestic abuse and violence and suicidality and self-harm.
