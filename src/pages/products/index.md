heading: What is Play Therapy?
description: >-
  In play therapy, children are supported to explore and process difficult
  feelings at their own pace and in the safety of the therapeutic relationship.
  They are provided the freedom to play in a self-directed manner, to express
  themselves and make sense of challenging life experiences using the toys and
  various creative media available, aided by the specially trained therapist.

        Play therapy recognises intuitively the key role of play in healthy
        development. Through play, children can communicate complex ideas and
        emotions which would otherwise be impossible due to lack of verbal
        skills and cognitive ability.

        Play therapy, therefore, responds to the unique developmental needs of
        children by using their natural medium of expression to help them
        externalise internal struggles and gain a better understanding of what’s
        going on inside them.

        Parents and carers are integral to the therapeutic process. With their
        commitment and support, children will be in the best place to work
        through any traumatic experiences or emotional, social and behavioural
        challenges.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    Accessing emotional support from an independent, non-judgemental and
    empathic therapist can facilitate self-expression, communication, positive
    relationships and emotional growth. Using the toys and play materials
    provided enables children to use symbols and metaphor to create safe
    psychological distance from what is troubling them. Freedom to play, make
    choices and explore personal narratives then allows them to take control and
    gain mastery over what may have happened to them.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
