heading: What is Play Therapy?
description: >-
  In play therapy, children are supported to explore and process difficult
  feelings at their own pace and in the safety of the therapeutic relationship.
  They are provided the freedom to play in a self-directed manner, to express
  themselves and make sense of challenging life experiences using the toys and
  various creative media available, aided by the specially trained therapist. 
  Play therapy recognises intuitively the key role of play in healthy
  development. Through play, children can communicate complex ideas and emotions
  which would otherwise be impossible due to lack of verbal skills and cognitive
  ability. Play therapy, therefore, responds to the unique developmental needs
  of children by using their natural medium of expression to help them
  externalise internal struggles and gain a better understanding of what’s going
  on inside them.  Parents and carers are integral to the therapeutic process.
  With their commitment and support, children will be in the best place to work
  through any traumatic experiences or emotional, social and behavioural
  challenges.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Accessing emotional support from an independent, non-judgemental and
    empathic therapist can facilitate self-expression, communication, positive
    relationships and emotional growth. Using the toys and play materials
    provided enables children to use symbols and metaphor to create safe
    psychological distance from what is troubling them. Freedom to play, make
    choices and explore personal narratives then allows them to take control and
    gain mastery over what may have happened to them.

      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.
